# YGO_Scanner

YGO_Scanner is a tool I am developing to recognise Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards and show their information in a GUI.

I am not sure of the direction of this, but the first step is to get it working reliably, on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and a Raspberry Pi Camera Module.

Please feel free to contribute or fork for your own project!
